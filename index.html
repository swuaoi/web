        <h1>About Me</h1>
     <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.niNj0YByocJDn0WABAPVSAHaE_?pid=ImgDet&rs=1">
<p>My name is Aoi.
My hobbies are watching Kabuki, watching airplanes, and listening to music. I often listen to classical music, kpop, and Western music. Since I was in junior high school, I have been going to see Kabuki every time my favorite actor appears.
 From the time I was in elementary school, I wanted to fly in the future and work in my favorite foreign language. 
When I was in elementary school, I met a person who became an in-house training pilot at a cram school. 
It became a dream to meet that senior and become a pilot. To get closer to this dream, I want to study not only Chinese and English but also a weather forecaster. 
I grew up in a girls' school at a middle and high school Catholic school. The important word I learned in junior high and high school is "Do what you want people to do." 
I want to cherish this word even in college and get involved with various friends.
My dream for the future is to work for an airline since I was a kid. Through various qualifications and experiences during college life, I would like to find new dreams as well as airlines.

   <h1>Before Studying In China </h1>

     I want to take hsk6 grade by the time I study abroad in China. When I studied abroad in England, I regretted not being able to speak English. 
   I also want to raise the TOEIC score. Therefore, I don't want to worry about language barriers when studying abroad. In China, I want to study traditional performing arts and visit world heritage sites, so I want to study before studying abroad. 
   I want to make friends with my college friends and travel with them. 
 <p>While studying abroad
I would like to participate in a circle related to Chinese culture locally. I want to make friends with people from various countries using Chinese.
